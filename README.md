Collection of ABAP examples for Quick PDF Library Lite from Debenu Pty Ltd

The Debenu company offers [here](http://www.debenu.com/products/development/debenu-pdf-library-lite/) the Quick PDF Library Lite. With this free COM library, which is available [here](http://www.debenu.com/products/development/debenu-pdf-library-lite/updates/), you have the possibility to create PDF files from ABAP via OLE interface easily. It offers basic functionalities to create and manipulate PDF files.
To use this library I programmed a wrapper class, which is available in this GitHub repository. With this class you can use all functions from the Debenu Quick PDF Library Lite 11.14 easily inside ABAP.

Often developers must code programs without the a real infrastructure. In our case a change request requires an interface to a PDF converter solution, which converts e-mail attachments from CRM Electronic Response Management System (ERMS) to PDF files, to archive them. With this way we have the possibility to simulate a PDF converter solution roughly, via Debenu Quick Library Lite. Good enough to build the interface basically and to get first experiences for this kind of development. So the developers can test their programs much better.

Thanks to Debenu company.
